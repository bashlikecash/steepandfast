Steep And Fast

This project is for Creative Coding 2. 

Objective:
Create a design with p5.js and get it running on Github pages.
The code should generate a custom (non-moving) shape inspired by the words “steep and fast”.

Outcome:
I used two ellipses and two custom shapes to picture a bike going downhill.
